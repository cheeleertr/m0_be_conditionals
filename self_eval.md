# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
It's useful to determine what happens when one or more conditions are met or not met.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I would probably use more commits after each section of each file to better document my progress when going through the assignment.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
I enjoyed practicing the things I learned this week because it lets me know that I've learned something. It also helped me find weaker spots in my knowledge and to work on things like being more aware of commiting my work at more logical times in my assignments.
